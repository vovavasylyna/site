<h1 id="the-power-of-listening">The power of listening</h1>

<p>2023-11-16</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking that if you want to change somebody’s mind or persuade them, arguing might not be the right way. Instead, it’s all about tuning in and really listening. Just my two cents, but I’m aiming to elaborate why this could be the secret sauce to cooler discussions.</p>

<p>So, we live in a world that’s got its fair share of disagreements. And I’ve been thinking, maybe there’s a better way than throwing words like confetti at each other. What if the key is starting with curiosity, not trying to win a debate?</p>

<p>Now, here’s where the magic happens: active listening. It’s not just about hearing words. It’s about really getting what someone’s saying. It’s like swapping swords for shields — people drop their defence when they feel understood.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed something interesting. When people feel heard, they’re more likely to ease up on the extreme opinions. It’s like they get a chance to reflect instead of sticking to their guns. And suddenly, it’s not a battlefield of ideas anymore.</p>

<p>I believe curiosity is the unsung hero. Instead of trying to sell your point, what if you’re genuinely curious about what others think? It’s like exploring uncharted territories together. Curiosity flips the script — disagreements become less about winning and more about learning. You might even find common ground where you least expect it.</p>
