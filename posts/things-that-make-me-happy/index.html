<p>2024-06-14</p>

<p>Just read <a href="https://kevquirk.com/things-that-make-me-happy">this post</a> by Kev Quirk listing the things that make him happy. So I figured to sit and think of my own list of some small things that make my day better. Here it is.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Driving a car. Especially if it’s a long ride with my fiancee to a different part of the country.</li>
  <li>Buying and reading a new book. Especially if it’s a good-looking, nicely designed book that feels good to the touch. Best if it’s written by a contemporary Ukrainian writer.</li>
  <li>Saving money. I feel safe when I realize I was able to do some monthly savings. The more the better.</li>
  <li>Working from a coffee place or a bookstore. Feeling lucky we have lots of such things in Kyiv.</li>
  <li>Doing exercise. To be accurate, I love the feeling of being slightly tired yet relieved after doing exercise.</li>
  <li>Enjoying a nice cool, moderate weather. 20℃ ideally.</li>
  <li>Visiting Lviv for a few days.</li>
  <li>Carpathian mountains. Renting <a href="/posts/my-list-of-cabins-in-the-carpathians-for-solitude-and-privacy.html">a nice cabin</a> there and chilling.</li>
  <li>Travel abroad. Not possible for me now but hopefully someday I make progress in regards to <a href="/posts/countries-and-cities.html">the list of countries</a> I visited.</li>
  <li>Listening to music. I enjoy Паліндром and Ницо Потворно as well as several cloud rap musicians like Lil Peep, Suisside, Lil Cobaine.</li>
  <li>Drinking Club-Mate, my soft drink of choice.</li>
  <li>Getting into bed after a long day. What a beautiful feeling!</li>
</ol>
