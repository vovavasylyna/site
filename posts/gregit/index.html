<p>2024-08-26</p>

<p>Last week, I had one of the best vacation experiences ever.</p>

<p>It was our honeymoon. Nastya, my wife, and I rented Gregit, a cabin located far up in the Carpathian mountains (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hatynky/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ozgZomjRHrGSVXMg9">Google Maps location</a>). Its remote location makes it a perfect place to hide from others, giving you a chance to enjoy nature and focus on yourself, your thoughts, and your feelings.</p>

<p>In the city, we’re constantly bombarded by tons of information, which we digest every single second. Noise, meetings, people, and their emotions—everything around you demands your undivided attention.</p>

<p>Once you’re in a rural area, all of that is gone. This void and the feeling of emptiness are scary at first but really satisfying when you just relax and let your mind wander. It took some time for me to get used to it, but it was worth it.</p>

<p>Although the cabin was very remote, we did have neighbors. Four sheep were happy to see us when we had food to share, but most of the time, they were hanging out on their own.</p>

<p>Saturday was the day we visited the Kosiv market. Nastya loves it so much! The market is known for traditional Hutsul clothes like vyshyvankas [embroidered shirts], lizhnyks [patterned wool blankets], rugs, artisanal tableware, and little horses made out of cheese. We bought a bunch of things, including a few old jugs made in the Kosiv painted ceramics style.</p>

<p>On top of it all, we even found a bookstore/coffee place in the small village of Verkhnii Yaseniv. The surroundings are awesome. The selection of books, as well as the coffee, has some room for improvement.</p>

<p>The best part of the trip took place the last day when we hiked to visit Ternoshory and then finished with a beautiful evening by the fire.</p>
