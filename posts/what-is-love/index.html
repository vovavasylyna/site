<h1 id="what-is-love">What is love</h1>

<p>2022-12-12</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>«Love, it seems to me, is that condition in which one is most contentedly oneself. If this sounds paradoxical, remember Rilke’s admonition: love consists in leaving the loved one space to be themselves while providing the security within which the self may flourish.»</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9413960-the-memory-chalet">The Memory Chalet</a> by Tony Judt)</p>

<p>The book itself is a sometimes melancholic story of a terminally ill person, where they recall episodes and stages of their life, reflect on topics of interest in the form of essays. About half of them are not close to me, but I enjoy the other half.</p>
