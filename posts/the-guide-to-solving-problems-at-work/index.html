<p>2024-05-01</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Describe the problem in a message you plan to send to a co-worker or a client. Write it down as detailed as possible.</p>

<p>Most of the time you’ll solve the problem before you’re done with Step 1. However, if you complete Step 1 and still have the problem, continue to Step 2.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Hit the “Send” button.</p>

<p>Shortly after sending, the solution will present itself. I don’t know why this is. But the solution frequently presents itself after you hit “Send” and no longer need the recipient’s help.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Return to message you just sent and follow up with: “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C40w-f3PA7I">Nevermind. Figured it out.</a>”</p>

<p>Alright, this is a just a joke. But it is a good method for getting yourself unstuck. Taking the problem out of your head and laying it down in the text format helps a lot.</p>
