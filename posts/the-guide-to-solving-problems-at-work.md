# The guide to solving problems at work

**Step 1**: Describe the problem in a message you plan to send to a co-worker or a client. Write it down as detailed as possible.

Most of the time you’ll solve the problem before you’re done with Step 1. However, if you complete Step 1 and still have the problem, continue to Step 2.

**Step 2**: Hit the “Send” button.

Shortly after sending, the solution will present itself. I don’t know why this is. But the solution frequently presents itself after you hit “Send” and no longer need the recipient’s help.

**Step 3**: Return to message you just sent and follow up with: “[Nevermind. Figured it out.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C40w-f3PA7I)”

Alright, this is a just a joke. But it is a good method for getting yourself unstuck. Taking the problem out of your head and laying it down in the text format helps a lot.
