<h1 id="why-to-write">Why to write</h1>

<p>2021-09-09</p>

<p>A quote from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55825273-the-comfort-book">The Comfort Book</a> by Matt Haig clearly articulating yet another reason of why I am pushing myself to write more:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… Nowadays, I sometimes write about what I want. The key to this is honesty. Be brutally, humiliatingly honest. I recommend this.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, you could write “I want a six-pack.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And seeing that wish on the page might automatically make you realize something about it. It might make you feel silly for having it. You might already be awakening another part of you that helps you diminish the craving. But either way, it is good to ask a single-word question after it. “Why?” Why do I want a six-pack? Then to be entirely honest in your answer. “I want to look good.” And again: “Why?” “For myself.” And then you might stare at that answer for a while and feel you weren’t being entirely honest. So you add: “To impress other people.” And then, like some incessant Socrates, ask it again: “Why?” “Because I want their approval.” “Why?” “Because I want to belong.” “Why?” And you can keep going, deeper and deeper, through the tunnel of whys, until you reach the light of realization. And the realization may be that wanting the six-pack wasn’t really about the six-pack. It wasn’t about your body. It wasn’t even about health or strength or fitness. It was about something else entirely. Something that wouldn’t be fundamentally addressed or solved by gaining the six-pack.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing, then, is a kind of seeing. A way to see your insecurities more clearly. A way to shine a light on doubts and dreams and realize what they are actually about. It can dissolve a whole puddle of worries in the bright light of truth.</p>
