# Things That Make Me Happy

2024-06-14

Just read [this post](https://kevquirk.com/things-that-make-me-happy) by Kev Quirk listing the things that make him happy. So I figured to sit and think of my own list of some small things that make my day better. Here it is. 

1. Driving a car. Especially if it's a long ride with my fiancee to a different part of the country.
2. Buying and reading a new book. Especially if it's a good-looking, nicely designed book that feels good to the touch. Best if it's written by a contemporary Ukrainian writer. 
3. Saving money. I feel safe when I realize I was able to do some monthly savings. The more the better.
4. Working from a coffee place or a bookstore. Feeling lucky we have lots of such things in Kyiv.
5. Doing exercise. To be accurate, I love the feeling of being slightly tired yet relieved after doing exercise. 
6. Enjoying a nice cool, moderate weather. 20℃ ideally. 
7. Visiting Lviv for a few days. 
8. Carpathian mountains. Renting [a nice cabin](/posts/my-list-of-cabins-in-the-carpathians-for-solitude-and-privacy.html) there and chilling. 
9. Travel abroad. Not possible for me now but hopefully someday I make progress in regards to [the list of countries](/posts/countries-and-cities.html) I visited.
10. Listening to music. I enjoy Паліндром and Ницо Потворно as well as several cloud rap musicians like Lil Peep, Suisside, Lil Cobaine. 
11. Drinking Club-Mate, my soft drink of choice. 
12. Getting into bed after a long day. What a beautiful feeling!
