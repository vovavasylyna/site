<h1 id="youtube-has-become-ubiquitous">Youtube has become ubiquitous</h1>

<p>2021-10-26</p>

<p>I’ve just come to realization that my shift to consuming less social media content has been relatively easy mostly because I replaced it with the Youtube feed. I’ve been discarding this thought for quite some time, and now I just have to admit it. Youtube is becoming a new addiction.</p>

<p>Whenever I feel bored, lonely or need something to watch while eating, Youtube is the place to go to. And it’s been there for such a long time that these days I open it simply by default not only when I have nothing to do but also when my mind is seeking some place to hide and procrastinate. Basically it’s functioning the same way as Instagram or Facebook bulding a solid foundation for my impusive and uncontrolled consumption of content.</p>

<p>Having a Youtube Premium subscription doesn’t help here at all. It’s clearing out the way toward watching videos without any interruptions and keeps me in a comfortable ecosystem with Youtube Music.</p>

<p>Can Youtube be as harmful as traditional social media then? Seems like it can.</p>
